# A Game of Tag
Here's the first genuine game project from David L Heiserman's 1978 book "How to Design & Build Your Own Custom TV Games". It's a very simple game where two player squares are moved around the screen. When one square touches another, both players disappear from the screen (it's up to you to decide who is "it"). Originally even less complex, I opted to add a little beep sound for when the tag occurs. The pitch of the beep can be set with a jumper on the upper-right side of the board.

It's easy for the player charcaters to fly off the screen - I recommend marking on your potentiometer knobs a sort of "starting position". Anyways, I encourage you to take a look into the book and tweak the designs. There's one addition the book recommends that would add "inertia" to the moving squares! Have fun, and please don't hesitate to reach out with questions.
